    "# The Guess *Your* Number Game\n",
    "## Summary\n",
    "Creating a \"Guess My Number Game\" on Python is simple. The \"Guess Your Number Game\" is the opposite; the computer will try an guess a number that you are thinking of. It will record how many tries it takes to get your number.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Instructions\n",
    "- The number must be from 1 to 100\n",
    "- If your number is higher than what the computer guesses, type in 'higher'\n",
    "- If your number is lower than what the computer guesses, type in 'lower'\n",
    "- When the computer guesses correclty, type in 'correct'"
